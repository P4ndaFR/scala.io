      """|At EPITA (www.epita.fr), we recently presented a course in Category Theory for Programmers (ct4p), where we presented Categories with a mathematical foundation. To make everything make sense, we culminated the course with a history of mapping functions in Lisp and other functional programming languages. Simple lists from programming languages of the 1980s have be generalized in two different, incompatible ways: 1) powerful list manipulation libraries, and 2) functors and monads.
         |
         |We used Scala as a vehicle to develop commutative diagrams for mapping functions and showed how flatMap makes the diagrams in a Kleisli category commute.
         |
         |This presentation was judged as illuminating for the mathematicians helping them understand the programming perspective, and also illuminating for the programmers helping them understand what monad are and how they relate to Category Theory.
         |
         |This ScalaIO talk will be a overview of the EPITA CT4P course, with emphasis on commutation diagrams and simple Scala programming. The talk will be accessible to intermediate programmers of Scala, Python, Lisp and other languages.

The talk is about a state of the art platform used to build, run, evolve and operate data pipelines at Criteo: a project were Scala particularly shine. We will cover problem framing, core ideas and dive into our experience with SQL parsing, query planning and scheduling with quick introductions to the Scala libraries used. The talk is meant to be accessible to any junior developper and has food for though for tenured data engineers too.",

        |Open Source is all about collaboration. In the Scala world, we have a lot of eager talent hungry to learn together. The best way to learn to program is by doing. On the other hand, the core Scala projects have an ample supply of maintenance tasks ‚Äì bug fixing, minor feature implementation, and documentation. To match the demand with the supply, in the Summer of 2021, I initiated the project Scala 3 Compiler Academy. Organized by the Scala Center, the Academy aimed to provide an avenue for Scala engineers to start contributing to the Scala Compiler. The Academy was implemented online pair programming sessions and a YouTube channel where one could learn more about the compiler.

        |Now, two years later, with the format fleshed out and the lessons learnt, I'd like to share our journey with you. After attending my talk, you'll learn how the format works, and how to start a similar Spree for your own project as well!""".stripMargin,

         |
         |Beyond built-in rules execution to organize imports or remove unused code, Scalafix is very extensible thanks to its stable and beginner-friendly API to inspect Scala sources by traversing Scala Abstract Syntax Trees, raise linter errors and/or suggest rewrites to fix them. Like Scalafmt and the Metals language server, it heavily relies on the vibrant Scalameta ecosystem, allowing support of Scala 2.x and Scala 3.
         |
         |In this talk, we will demystify AST traversal and semantic information lookup to write custom rules and run them locally and/or on CI, through the sbt-scalafix plugin or via Scala Steward.
